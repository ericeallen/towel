# Design decisions

Each entry records a decision about what Towel promises or refuses, when it
was made, what it rules out, and why. An entry is not rewritten when it is
superseded; a later entry says so. Where an entry's consequences are still
being implemented, its status line says which.

The owner's standing rule frames all of them: a transformation that changes
what a program does is unsound, however rarely it triggers, and "rarely" is
not a defence. Declining is acceptable only where no sound transformation
exists; a decline that exists only because Towel lost information of its own
is a defect to fix, not a limitation to document.

## 2026-09-22: What Towel preserves

Every extraction changes something a program could in principle observe: a
traceback gains a frame, line numbers move, the module gains a name. So the
contract cannot be "nothing observable changes"; it has to say what is kept.

**Preserved:** return values; output; exceptions, by type and message; side
effects and their order; what importing a module does; and the names and
signatures of everything that existed before the refactoring.

**Not preserved:** stack frames and line numbers, and the existence of the new
helper names themselves.

Three consequences follow, each ruled on explicitly:

- **Objects created by moved code.** A function, lambda, generator or class
  created by moved code carries the helper's name in its `__qualname__`
  (`f1.<locals>.<lambda>` becomes `__extracted_func_0.<locals>.<lambda>`),
  which reaches output through `repr`, logging and registries; a dataclass's
  `repr` prints it. A block is declined unless every such object is provably
  only called within it, or passed only to a small set of builtins that call
  it and keep nothing (`sorted`/`min`/`max` keys, and `map`/`filter` whose
  iterator is consumed in the block).
- **No existing function is redirected to another.** When a duplicate is the
  whole body of an existing function, Towel used to rewrite `f2` as
  `return f1(...)`. A module-level call finds `f1` at call time, so a test
  patching `mod.f1` then changed `f2` too, and test suites patch module
  functions constantly. Both functions now call a new shared helper, so each
  existing function still depends only on itself.
- **Towel never adds anything to a class.** `A.m1(SimpleNamespace(v=10), 1)`
  runs on the original, and a helper reached through `self` breaks it; the
  owner's ruling of 2026-09-21 on `A.a(None, 3)` already said such calls
  count. Every helper is therefore a module-level function. A method's
  receiver becomes an explicit parameter, and private names are written in
  their mangled form (`self.__x` inside class `A` is `self._A__x`, which a
  module function can spell directly). Moved code that needs the class itself
  (zero-argument `super()`, `__class__`) is declined. This retires the defects
  that came from putting helpers in classes: helpers becoming `Protocol`
  members, class decorators rebuilding or wrapping the namespace, metaclass
  and `__init_subclass__` scans seeing the helper, subclasses overriding it,
  and rebound base names. Its costs: helpers stop being methods, a generic
  class's receiver needs a type variable in typed mode, and classes in
  different modules need an import where inheritance used to supply the
  helper.

## 2026-09-22: Import names come from the program

A module's name is not a property of its file. It depends on how the project
is installed or run, and every wrong import Towel wrote came from inventing an
answer: from packaging metadata (`src.waitress.task`, `foo.src.foo.a`), or
from the directory layout (`src.alpha.a` where `src/__init__.py` exists).
Checked against built wheels, the packaging readers named 1,039 of the
corpus's files wrongly when analysis started at a project's root, and "two
derivations must agree" failed exactly where both inventions agreed.

Towel now takes names only from the program's own imports.

Before refactoring it checks that those imports are well formed:

- every absolute import of a project module resolves to exactly one file (a
  stale `build/lib/alpha/` beside `src/alpha/`, or an installed package of the
  same name, makes `alpha` ambiguous);
- no file is reached under two names;
- no relative import climbs out of its top-level package.

Towel then writes:

- between two modules of one package, the spelling the importing file
  already uses for its neighbours, or a relative import;
- across top-level packages, an import only when the importing package
  already imports the other one, spelled as it already spells it.

`tests/` may borrow a helper from `alpha`, which it already imports; `alpha`
may never borrow one from `tests`. Anything else is declined. Packaging
metadata is no longer part of the soundness argument.

The costs, accepted:

- sibling packages that share a duplicate but never import each other get no
  shared helper;
- a directory of scripts that import nothing local gets no cross-file
  helpers;
- a project whose imports are ambiguous must exclude the stray copy first.

## 2026-09-22: Checked with the project's own checker, as configured

A candidate is verified by the checker the project configures, exactly as the
project configures it. Configured mypy plugins are loaded. Towel's worker used
to strip them as if they were settings about where to write output, but a
plugin is a type rule: without pydantic's plugin, mypy sees `Model(x=1)` as
taking `**data: Any`, and Towel accepted code the project's own mypy rejects.
Loading a plugin executes code the project's configuration names, which is
what the project's own `mypy` run does.

A configured checker or plugin that cannot run refuses the typed run, with
the checker's own error and the remedies, rather than verifying with less
than the project's check. A project that configures no checker keeps the
documented untyped behaviour.

*Status: being implemented on the `audit-1772` branch; not yet released.*

## 2026-09-22: Well-formed input

Towel requires a well-formed program before it refactors:

- every file it changes decodes in its declared encoding and parses;
- the program's imports pass the check above;
- in typed mode, the project's own checker runs as configured and its
  baseline is clean.

A file that does not parse is skipped rather than refused: it cannot run, so
nothing Towel does elsewhere can change its behaviour, and repositories often
keep deliberately invalid test data (17 of the corpus's first 52 projects
held files a checker could not build).

A valid file never contains a character its encoding cannot hold. Where
Towel's own rendering produced one, by printing the constant `"\u20ac"` back
as `€` into a Latin-1 file, the escape is written back inside its string
literal, and the result is kept only when it parses to the identical tree.

## 2026-09-22: When 1.772 ships

1.772 is released only after a from-scratch audit round finds no P1 in what
it probed. A P1 is a behaviour change or broken import reported as success,
or a false clean that leads to accepted output. The first round found about
twenty and the second sixteen, most in cross-module extraction. If a third
round still finds cross-module P1s, 1.772 ships with cross-module extraction
off by default behind a flag, and cross-module soundness becomes the next
release's work. The 141-project corpus then runs against the final commit.
Its recorded phases total about two hours, roughly half an hour to an hour of
wall time at four workers.
